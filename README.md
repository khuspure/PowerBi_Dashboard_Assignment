About Assignment 

You have been hired as a Power BI Developer for X Company. Your manager is struggling to get the data in the right format. The manager is asking to look into the data: 

The manager is finding various issues as follows:

1.	Data Understanding Issue: Your manager is finding it difficult to understand the empty and null percentages in the dataset.  He is also worried about the descriptive statistics (distribution) for all the top 1000 rows. You have been asked to show it in the power query. 
2.	Imputation of missing values: The data architect just informed your manager about a possible missing value with the column Region in the excel provided. He insisted on replacing all the missing values in Region with West. Now you are being asked to perform the data imputation. 
3.	Date Format issue: The data has been fetched from the European regionâ€™s server due to which the data format is of European standards dd/mm/yyyy. As the data is generated and relevant for the US time zone. Your manager is asking you to convert the date to US/Canadian format i.e mm/dd/yyyy. 
4.	Tax Slab Calculation: All the products sold(profit column) from the store are taxed with a standard tax slab of 2%. Your manager wants you to create a tax slab column so that it can be used for visualization. 
5.	Performance of Query: The manager also wants to have a check on the performance of the power query. So he is asking to generate the metric table as well.
